### 👩‍💻 About Me  
I’m a **freelance data scientist and AI content creator** passionate about turning raw data and models into something that actually makes sense to humans.  

Currently pursuing **M.Sc. in Big Data Analytics** at *St. Xavier’s College*, I balance my time between building data projects, testing large language models, and writing about the tech world that keeps evolving faster than my coffee brews.  

I’ve worked with **TELUS International** (AI Data Partner) and **Mindrift** (AI Agent Assistant), refining AI systems through multimodal labeling, prompt evaluation, and dataset optimization.  

When I’m not fine-tuning models, I’m building mini-apps on **Hugging Face Spaces**, designing dashboards, or writing posts for **Tech Data Hub** and **NovemberAI**, my growing online brand for AI and data learning.
